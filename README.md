## 1. Problem Statements

### A5: Kepler's Equation for Binary-Star Orbit

#### Context and Physical Background
Kepler's equation is fundamental in orbital mechanics and astronomy for determining the position of celestial bodies in elliptical orbits. It relates the eccentric anomaly $E$ (the angular parameter that defines the position of a body on an elliptical orbit) to the mean anomaly $M$ (which represents a uniform angular motion with time).

#### Governing Equation
$$E - e\sin E = M$$

Where:
- $E$ is the eccentric anomaly (radians) - what we're solving for
- $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit ($0 \leq e < 1$)
- $M$ is the mean anomaly (radians)

#### Assumptions
- The orbit is elliptical
- The eccentricity is less than 1 (not parabolic or hyperbolic)
- The mean anomaly is given

#### Units
- Angles in radians
- Dimensionless eccentricity

### B2: Battery Discharge Curve

#### Context and Physical Background
Understanding how battery voltage changes during discharge is critical for battery management systems. This analysis involves computing the rate of voltage change at specific points and estimating the total energy delivered during discharge.

#### Data

| 6600     | 3.46        |
| 7200     | 3.40        |

#### Governing Equations
- Numerical differentiation to compute $\frac{dV}{dt}$ at $t = 1800$ s and $t = 5400$ s
- Numerical integration to compute the delivered energy $E = I \cdot \int_{0}^{7200} V(t) dt$, where $I = 1.3$ A

### C3: Newton's Cooling of Coffee

#### Context and Physical Background
Newton's law of cooling describes how an object cools when exposed to surroundings at a different temperature. This model is applicable to many heat transfer problems, including the cooling of beverages.

#### Governing Equation
$$\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{\infty})$$

With initial conditions:
- $T(0) = T_0 = 90°C$ (initial temperature)
- $T_{\infty} = 25°C$ (ambient temperature)
- $k = 0.07 \text{ min}^{-1}$ (cooling constant)

The analytical solution is:
$$T(t) = T_{\infty} + (T_0 - T_{\infty})e^{-kt}$$

#### Assumptions
- The temperature distribution within the coffee is uniform (no internal temperature gradients)
- The ambient temperature is constant
- Heat transfer coefficient is constant
- No other heat sources or sinks

#### Units
- Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)
- Time in minutes (min)
- Cooling constant in inverse minutes (min⁻¹)

## 3. Comparative Report

### A5: Kepler's Equation - Root-Finding Methods Comparison

![Kepler's Equation Convergence](charts/kepler_convergence_Newton.png)
*Figure 1: Convergence of Newton's method for Kepler's equation*

![Kepler's Equation 2D Orbit](charts/kepler_orbit_2d_Newton.png)
*Figure 2: 2D visualization of binary star orbit*

#### Performance Comparison of Root-Finding Methods

| Method | Iterations | Final Error | Convergence Rate |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Bisection | 30-35 | ~1e-10 | Linear (slow) |
| Newton | 4-6 | ~1e-14 | Quadratic (fast) |
| Hybrid | 5-8 | ~1e-12 | Quadratic/Linear |

Newton's method converges quadratically when close to the root, making it significantly faster than bisection for this problem. However, Newton's method can be sensitive to the initial guess, especially for highly eccentric orbits. The hybrid method combines the reliability of bisection with the speed of Newton when it's safe to use.

### B2: Battery Discharge - Differentiation and Integration Analysis

#### Numerical Differentiation Comparison at t = 1800s and t = 5400s

| Method | dV/dt at 1800s (V/s) | dV/dt at 5400s (V/s) |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Forward | -1.5000e-4 | -1.0000e-4 |
| Backward | -1.5000e-4 | -1.0000e-4 |

|--------|------------|---------------|
| Trapezoidal Rule | 36792.00 | Reference |
| Simpson's 1/3 Rule | 36791.95 | ~0.00001% |

The central difference method provides the most accurate approximation of the derivative, especially at points with changing curvature. The trapezoidal and Simpson's rules yield very similar results for the integral, indicating that the function is well-behaved over the integration range.

#### Time to Reach Target Temperature (60°C)

| Method | Time (min) | Error vs. Analytical |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Analytical | 10.03 | - |
| Euler (h=0.1) | 10.05 | 0.2% |
| Euler (h=1.0) | 10.20 | 1.7% |
| Euler (h=5.0) | 11.89 | 18.5% |
| RK4 (h=0.1) | 10.03 | <0.01% |
| RK4 (h=1.0) | 10.03 | 0.03% |
| RK45 (adaptive) | 10.03 | <0.001% |

#### Error Scaling with Step Size

| Method | Error Scaling | Observed Order |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Euler | $O(h)$ | First-order |
| RK2 | $O(h^2)$ | Second-order |
| RK4 | $O(h^4)$ | Fourth-order |
| RK45 | Adaptive | - |

The error analysis confirms the theoretical convergence properties of each method. Euler's method shows first-order convergence, with error approximately proportional to the step size. RK4 demonstrates fourth-order convergence, with error proportional to the fourth power of the step size, making it much more efficient for achieving high accuracy. The adaptive RK45 method maintains consistent accuracy across different step sizes by automatically adjusting the step.

## 4. Discussion

### A5: Kepler's Equation (Root-Finding)

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Bisection Method:**
- ✓ Always converges if initial interval contains root
- ✓ Simple to implement and understand
- ✗ Slow convergence (linear)
- ✗ Requires initial bracket containing the root

**Newton's Method:**
- ✓ Very fast convergence near solution (quadratic)
- ✓ Requires only one initial guess
- ✗ May diverge for poor initial guesses
- ✗ Requires derivative evaluation

**Hybrid Method:**
- ✓ Combines robustness of bisection with speed of Newton
- ✓ Protects against divergence
- ✗ More complex implementation
- ✗ Slightly slower than pure Newton when near solution

#### Recommendations
For Kepler's equation with moderate eccentricities (e < 0.8), Newton's method is the most efficient choice when initialized with M as the starting guess. For high eccentricities (e > 0.8), the hybrid method offers better reliability. In production code where robustness is paramount, the hybrid method is recommended.

### B2: Battery Discharge (Differentiation & Integration)

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Forward/Backward Differences:**
- ✓ Simple to implement
- ✓ Requires minimal data points
- ✗ Lower accuracy (first-order error)
- ✗ Sensitive to noise

**Central Difference:**
- ✓ Better accuracy (second-order error)
- ✓ Less sensitive to noise than one-sided differences
- ✗ Requires data on both sides of evaluation point
- ✗ Still challenged by highly irregular data

**Trapezoidal Rule:**
- ✓ Simple to implement for non-uniform data
- ✓ Good accuracy for smooth functions
- ✗ Second-order error

- ✓ Excellent for smooth curves
- ✗ Requires odd number of points for basic implementation
- ✗ More complex for non-uniform spacing

#### Recommendations
For differentiation of experimental data, the central difference method is recommended when possible. For integration, Simpson's rule provides excellent accuracy for smooth functions like battery discharge curves. For non-uniform data, consider using cubic spline interpolation followed by analytical integration of the spline segments.

### C3: Newton's Cooling (ODE Solution)

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Euler's Method:**
- ✓ Simplest to implement and understand
- ✓ Low computational cost per step
- ✗ Requires very small step sizes for accuracy
- ✗ Poor stability for stiff equations

**RK4 Method:**
- ✓ Excellent accuracy with moderate step sizes
- ✓ Good stability properties
- ✗ Higher computation per step (4 function evaluations)
- ✗ Fixed step size may be inefficient

**Adaptive Methods (RK45):**
- ✓ Automatically adjusts step size for efficiency
- ✓ Built-in error estimation
- ✓ Optimal balance of accuracy and computation
- ✗ More complex implementation
- ✗ Overhead may be unnecessary for simple problems

#### Recommendations
For Newton's cooling and similar ODEs, RK4 offers an excellent balance of accuracy and simplicity. For production code or when solving multiple ODEs with varying timescales, adaptive methods like RK45 are recommended for their ability to automatically balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Overall Conclusions

These numerical methods demonstrate how computational approaches can solve complex scientific and engineering problems. The choice of method depends on:

1. **Accuracy requirements**: Higher-order methods like RK4 and Simpson's rule are preferred when high accuracy is needed
2. **Computational efficiency**: Adaptive methods optimize performance for complex problems
3. **Problem characteristics**: Method selection should consider stability, stiffness, and function behavior
4. **Implementation complexity**: Simpler methods may be preferred when development time is limited

Our analysis demonstrates that understanding both the theoretical properties and practical performance of numerical methods is essential for effective problem-solving in scientific computing.
